# Example scripts for the BerryClip Plus GPIO Board

The BerryClip+ is an enhanced version of the popular BerryClip add-on board.
It is a simple, cheap and easy to use addition to the Raspberry Pi.
It plugs directly onto the Pi's GPIO header and provides 6 coloured LEDs, 1 Buzzer,
2 Switches and a 13 pin header. It can be controlled using any programming language
that can manipulate the GPIO pins and this includes Python and C.
The 13 pin header allows additional components and sensors to be added.
